DCE authentication/DFS fileset patch (version 3.1) for samba 2.2.7
------------------------------------------------------------------

This patch adds support for DCE authentication and DFS filesets to
samba 2.2.7. In addition to plaintext password support, encrypted
passwords are supported with the optional sec_auth package.
Other features include DFS fileset quota reporting and Windows
Terminal Server connection multiplexing.

To apply the patch, first acquire the samba distribution, and then
execute the commands:

     cd /path/to/samba-2.2.7
     patch -p1 -d . < /path/to/samba-2.2.7-dce-3.1.diff


See the file docs/textdocs/README.DCEDFS after applying the patch
for configuration information.
