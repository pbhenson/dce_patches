DCE authentication patch (version 1.1) for Academ wu-ftpd 2.4.2 release
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


This patch adds DCE authentication to Academ's wu-ftpd version
2.4.2 release. You can retrieve this version of wu-ftpd via the URL:

ftp://ftp.academ.com/pub/wu-ftpd/wu-ftpd-2.4.2.tar.Z


To apply the patch, acquire and untar the wu-ftpd distribution, change into
the wu-ftpd-2.4.2 directory and type:

patch -p1 -d . < /path/to/wu-ftpd-2.4.2-dce-1.1.diff


This patch has only been tested under Solaris 2.6/Transarc 2.0, and it
should compile in that environment without any problems. Makefile
modifications for AIX 4.1 were contributed by Mark Plaksin
<happy@arches.uga.edu>, and you should be able to compile on that platform
with no changes, but I haven't tested it myself.

If you want to use this patch with a different vendor's DCE, you will
need to edit the appropriate Makefile in src/makefiles for your system
and add the correct libraries. You can refer to src/makefiles/Makefile.sol
as an example.

If your OS doesn't support DCE as a naming service, you will need to
replicate your registry in local files for wu-ftpd to work. Solaris
users can install my nss_dce package to integrate DCE into the Solaris
naming service switch:
