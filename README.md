These are a collection of patches written in the late 90's/early 2000's to
integrate DCE functionality into various software packages. No one uses DCE
anymore, and these patches are for ancient versions of the software; but
perhaps they might be an interesting curiosity or good fodder for reminiscing
about those days...
